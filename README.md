# Pyber-Analysis
In this exercise we are able to get a better idea of where riders are in comparision to drivers in which city types, how much they are making per ride and where there is opportunity missed within the company.

## Results
 With this data we can determine that the most drivers and rides taken exist in the Urban cities followed by the suburban then rural in that order.
 We also see that the longer more profitable rides flip that order as the rural areas have longer rides which makes sense for longer distance between typical starting and stopping points.
 
 ### Summary
 the issue that stands out the most is that there are more drivers than rides in the rural areas. This is an issue for drivers looking to earn a living. They could give incentive for these drivers to spread out to the more lucrative rides in the rural and suburban areas. However perhaps the drivers are working very part time and that is not an issue for them. 
Pyber could aslo work to get more riders within the urban cities to even out these numebers as they do have the benefit of many drivers already working there.
Just sharing this data with drivers may incentivise them to leave the urban cities for some work days as they would likeley recieve a higher amount of rides during their time spent working as well as a better rate per ride (longer rides). Which in the end gives the driver more profit which we can assume would be in their interest.
Spreading out the wealth in this sense would give drivers more incentive to continue to work for Pyber as well as improve response time in the more rural and suburban cities. The issue would be losing them all fro the city and creating a new different imbalance that would be less than ideal for Pyber.
